#### HTTP Request Flow
1. Users/Client access websites through domain nammes. such as api.ebay.com. Usually the Domain Name System (DNS) is a paid service provided by 3rd parties and not hosted by our server
2. Internet Protocal (IP) address is returned to the browser or mobile app.  For example, IP address 15.125.23.214 is returned from DNS
3. Once the IP address is obtained at Client, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests are sent directly to your web server using IP address 15.125.23.234
