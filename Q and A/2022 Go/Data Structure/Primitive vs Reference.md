### HTTP
#### HTTP Request Flow
1. Users/Client access websites through domain nammes. such as api.ebay.com. Usually the Domain Name System (DNS) is a paid service provided by 3rd parties and not hosted by our server
2. Internet Protocal (IP) address is returned to the browser or mobile app.  For example, IP address 15.125.23.234 is returned from DNS
3. Once the IP address is obtained at Client, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests are sent directly to your web server using IP address 15.125.23.234
4. The web server returns HTML pages or JSON response for rendering
#### HTTPS Request Flow
- The S in HTTPS stands for "secure". HTTPS uses TLS(or SSL) to encrypt HTTP requests and responses
- Just like an ID card confirms a person's identity, a private key confirms server identity. When a client opens a channel with an origin server (e.g. when a user navigates to a website), possession of the private key that matches with the public key in a website's SSL certificate proves that the server is actually the legitimate host of the website. This prevents or helps block a number of attacks that are possible when there is no authentication, such as:
#### TSL
- TLS uses a technology called  **public key cryptography**, there are two  keys, a public key and a private key, and the public key is shared with client devices via the server's SSL certificate. When a client opens a connection with a server, the two devices use the public and private key to agree on new keys, called  session keys, to encrypt further communications between them
- All HTTP requests and responses are then encrypted with these session keys, so that anyone who intercepts communications can only see a random string of characters, not the plaintext.

- Prerequisite: root certificate of the intermediate server is present in the trust-store
**Step 1** - The client requests to establish a TCP connection with the server. The request is maliciously routed to an intermediate server, instead of the real backend server. Then, a TCP connection is established between the client and the intermediate server.  
**Step 2** - The intermediate server establishes a TCP connection with the actual server.  
**Step 3** - The intermediate server sends the SSL certificate to the client. The certificate contains the public key, hostname, expiry dates, etc. The client validates the certificate.  
**Step 4** - The legitimate server sends its certificate to the intermediate server. The intermediate server validates the certificate.  
**Step 5** - The client generates a session key and encrypts it using the public key from the intermediate server. The intermediate server receives the encrypted session key and decrypts it with the private key.  
**Step 6** - The intermediate server encrypts the session key using the public key from the actual server and then sends it there. The legitimate server decrypts the session key with the private key.  
**Steps 7 and 8** - Now, the client and the server can communicate using the session key (symmetric encryption.) The encrypted data is transmitted in a secure bi-directional channel. The intermediate server can always decrypt the data.

### Vertical Scaling Server
-  Vertical scaling, referred to as "scale up", means the process of adding more power (CPU, RAM, etc) to your server/instance resource
#### Pros
- Simplicity
- When traffic is low, vertical scaling is a great option
#### Cons
- Vertical scaling has a hard limit. It is impossible to add unlimited CPU and memory to a
single server.
-  Vertical scaling does not have failover and redundancy. If one server goes down, the
website/app goes down with it completely.
### Horizontal Scaling Server
- Horizontal scaling, referred to as "scale out", allows you to scale by adding more servers into your pool of resources
- Horizontal scaling is more desirable for large scale applications due to the limitations of vertical scaling like failover
	- the web server is down
	- if many requests need to access theweb server simultaneously and it reaches the web serverâ€™s load limit,
- How to handle Horizontal Scalling Servers? Load Balancer
### Load Balancer
- A load balancer **evenly distributes incoming traffic among web servers** that are defined in a load-balanced set
- This is to **resolve issue such as failover and redundancy**
- Clients/Users **connect to the public IP of the load balancer directly.** With this setup, web servers are unreachable directly by clients anymore. 
#### Private IP
- For better security, private IPs are used for communication between servers. **A private IP is an IP address reachable only between servers in the same network; however, it is unreachable over the internet**. The load balancer communicates with web servers through private IPs.


### When to use use Non-relational databases
- Your application requires super-low latency
- Your data are unstructured, or you do not have any relational data
- You only need to serialize and deserialize data (JSON, XML, YAML, etc)
- You need to store a massive amount of data
### Database Replication/Master-Slave
- A master database generally only supports write operations. 
- A slave database gets copies of the data from the master database and only supports read operations
- Most applications require a much higher ratio of reads to writes; thus, the number of slave databases in a system is usually larger than the number of master databases
#### Pros
- **Better performance**: In the master-slave model, all writes and updates happen in master nodes; whereas, read operations are distributed across slave nodes. **This model improves performance because it allows more queries to be processed in parallel.**
- **Reliability**: If one of your database servers is **destroyed by a natural disaster,** such as a typhoon or an earthquake, data is still preserved. You do not need to worry about data loss **because data is replicated across multiple locations.**
- **High availability**: By r**eplicating data across different locations**, your website remains in operation even if a database is offline as **you can access data stored in another database server**.
#### What if a Slave Database goes down
- If only one slave database is available and it goes offline, **read operations will be directed to the master database temporarily**. 
	- In case multiple slave databases are available, read operations are redirected to other healthy slave databases.
- As soon as the issue is found, **a new slave database will replace the old one**.
