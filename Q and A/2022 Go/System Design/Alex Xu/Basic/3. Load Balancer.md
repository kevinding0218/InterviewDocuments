### Load Balancer
- A load balancer **evenly distributes incoming traffic among web servers** that are defined in a load-balanced set
- This is to **resolve issue such as failover and redundancy**
- Clients/Users **connect to the public IP of the load balancer directly.** With this setup, web servers are unreachable directly by clients anymore. 
#### Private IP
- For better security, private IPs are used for communication between servers. **A private IP is an IP address reachable only between servers in the same network; however, it is unreachable over the internet**. The load balancer communicates with web servers through private IPs.
