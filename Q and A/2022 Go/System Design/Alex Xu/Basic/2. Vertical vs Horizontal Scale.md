### Vertical Scaling Server
-  Vertical scaling, referred to as "scale up", means the process of adding more power (CPU, RAM, etc) to your server/instance resource
#### Pros
- Simplicity
- When traffic is low, vertical scaling is a great option
#### Cons
- Vertical scaling has a hard limit. It is impossible to add unlimited CPU and memory to a
single server.
-  Vertical scaling does not have failover and redundancy. If one server goes down, the
website/app goes down with it completely.
### Horizontal Scaling Server
- Horizontal scaling, referred to as "scale out", allows you to scale by adding more servers into your pool of resources
- Horizontal scaling is more desirable for large scale applications due to the limitations of vertical scaling like failover
	- the web server is down
	- if many requests need to access theweb server simultaneously and it reaches the web serverâ€™s load limit,
