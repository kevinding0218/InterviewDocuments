### What Is Inversion of Control
- IOC transfers the control of objects or portions of a program to a container or framework.
- In contrast with traditional programming, in which our custom code makes calls to a library, IoC enables a framework to take control of the flow of a program and make calls to our custom code. To enable this, frameworks use abstractions with additional behavior built in. **If we want to add our own behavior, we need to extend the classes of the framework or plugin our own classes.**
