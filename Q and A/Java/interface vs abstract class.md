### Interface vs Abstract Class
#### Variable Type
- The interface has only static and final variables.
- Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. 
#### Method Type
- Interface can have only abstract methods. 
- An abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods
#### Implementation
- A Class can implement multiple interfaces
- A Class can inherit only one Abstract Class ecause [Java does not support multiple inheritances](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2011/07/why-multiple-inheritances-are-not.html)
