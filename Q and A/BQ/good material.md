Good engineers are usually excellent project managers and then become solid engineering leaders.  
  
Every role in engineering, regardless of seniority, demands organization. Whether managing a feature rollout or resolving production incidents, a structured approach ensures success and minimizes chaos.  
  
Here's how I try to approach driving long and complex projects (like DiceDB). You can leverage pointers and apply them at your workplace. Every project must be estimated and weighted against returns. Always pick the most impactful ones requiring minimal effort.  
  
A key to getting a project delivered  
  
1. well-defined scope - what and why  
2. well-defined outcome - clear metrics and deliverables  
3. clarity in the schedule of delivery - timeline, and accountability  
4. seamless communication - overcommunication >> silence  
5. ownership of critical sections - clarity  
  
A good engineer doesn't just write great code, they  
  
1. manage their work like a project is maintained  
2. works across the T shape to put it to completion.  
3. follows timelines, breaks down tasks well  
4. proactively identifies blockers and finds creative solutions  
  
So, do not run away from project or management responsibilities, rather take them head-on. It is a great opportunity to make a bigger impact. This dual capability sets apart good engineers from great ones.
