Good engineers are usually excellent project managers and then become solid engineering leaders.  
  
Every role in engineering, regardless of seniority, demands organization. Whether managing a feature rollout or resolving production incidents, a structured approach ensures success and minimizes chaos.  
  
Here's how I try to approach driving long and complex projects (like DiceDB). You can leverage pointers and apply them at your workplace. Every project must be estimated and weighted against returns. Always pick the most impactful ones requiring minimal effort.  
  
A key to getting a project delivered  
  
1. well-defined scope - what and why  
2. well-defined outcome - clear metrics and deliverables  
3. clarity in the schedule of delivery - timeline, and accountability  
4. seamless communication - overcommunication >> silence  
5. ownership of critical sections - clarity  
  
A good engineer doesn't just write great code, they  
  
1. manage their work like a project is maintained  
2. works across the T shape to put it to completion.  
3. follows timelines, breaks down tasks well  
4. proactively identifies blockers and finds creative solutions  
  
So, do not run away from project or management responsibilities, rather take them head-on. It is a great opportunity to make a bigger impact. This dual capability sets apart good engineers from great ones.


As you move into an engineering architect role, one of the most important mindset shifts is learning to prioritize solving the problem over loyalty to a particular technology stack. It‚Äôs tempting to stick with the tools you know and love‚Äîbut architecture is about building systems that last, scale, and deliver value, not about championing your favorite tech.  
  
Here‚Äôs why being technology-agnostic matters:  
üîπ The right tool for the job: Every problem is unique, and so is the best solution. The frameworks, languages, or platforms that served you well in one scenario might not be the best choice in another. Staying open to different options ensures you can align technical decisions with business needs.  
  
üîπ Future-proofing your solutions: Technology evolves rapidly. Being adaptable to new tools and approaches not only keeps you competitive but also helps future-proof the systems you design.  
  
üîπ Collaboration and inclusion: Teams often have diverse skill sets. Choosing tools that align with the team‚Äôs strengths‚Äîor are easy to learn‚Äîfosters collaboration and accelerates delivery.  
  
üîπ Cost and efficiency: Sometimes, the best solution isn‚Äôt the flashiest or newest; it‚Äôs the one that balances functionality, cost, and maintainability. Architects need to balance tech-savvy decisions with business impact.  
The journey to technology agnosticism starts with one simple but profound habit: always ask ‚ÄúWhy is this the best tool for this problem?‚Äù instead of defaulting to what you already know.

  
While I hit the timing jackpot - right org, explosive growth phase, and a manager who saw something in me before I saw it myself - there were six key principles that shaped my journey:  
  
1. Speed as a multiplier - Mastering core work quickly creates bandwidth for growth  
  
2. Operating above your level - Using extra time to think and work like someone a level up  
  
3. Embracing uncertainty - Realizing no one has all the answers freed me to contribute boldly  
  
4. Focusing on simple solutions - Sometimes the clearest path beats technical sophistication  
  
5. Building a favor economy - Early goodwill compounds as careers progress  
  
6. Staying positive - A genuine enthusiasm for the work becomes a powerful accelerant  
  
The full post dives deep into each principle, sharing real examples from my time working on projects like counter-terrorism and suicide prevention at Meta.
