Brad

I am a developer that is most effective leading engineers, developing a customer-focused, results-oriented culture that excites and empowers engineers to do their best work. I'm obsessed with empowering people to be more effective and happy. I'm excited by hard problems that require deep domain expertise. I specialize at examining a complex problem, identifying what building blocks simplify the domain, building platform systems that provide those building blocks, then using those building blocks to make solutions that empower customers. I'm a technologist that has developed software for distributed systems using service-oriented architecture (SOA) for more than 26 years. I have a broad range of technology and leadership experience. I have a proven track record of tackling hard problems and building scalable robust solutions that enable organizations to do more faster.

  

When approaching a project, I take the customer perspective, then work backward, diving deep to understand the concerns and needs at each step, ensuring I deeply understand all the problems that need to be solved. With that deep understanding, I develop a vision for the future, and establish design tenets that guide incremental development.

  

With a vision and tenets, I focus on current systems. I look for recurring problems across organizations that if solved would eliminate the waste of redundant solutions. Focusing on long-term frugality, I develop a plan to evolve existing systems in phases to deliver the end vision. I structure systems to separate what is unique to a product away from what should be provided by shared platform systems. I look for platform solutions to use. Where appropriate solutions don't exist, I build them. Where needed technology doesn't exist, I invent it.

  

Then I evangelize the vision and plan to engineering teams across organizations. I connect with leaders, down to individual engineers, showing how their efforts fit into a larger plan and outline opportunities for growth. Shared vision is essential because every day, every engineer makes small decisions which architects and managers never see, that shape the final product. Without a shared vision, those small decisions are made based on whim, and accumulate as technical debt and architectural atrophy, slowing development, frustrating talented engineers, and sapping the motivation of others to improve. A shared vision gets engineers excited, and guides the small everyday decisions they make to shape systems, architectures, and the culture of teams, organizations and companies.

  

Ordering Systems

Technical lead and architect on cross-functional project funded by the Amazon company controller to update Amazon systems to comply with accounting rule changes required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 on revenue from contracts with customers. The project affected all consumer sales by Amazon.

  

Working with technical leadership, senior accounting staff, and the company controller, I advised how issues fundamental to distributed computing systems used by Amazon cause problems with certain specific accounting processes used at the time. I proposed how to alter business systems and accounting processes to eliminate distributed system issues, across all business systems, and provably conform to ASC 606 standards. I worked with senior management to get agreement with senior accountants, and the company controller to change the company wide process.

  

With the process change approved, I defined the high level technical changes to make across dozens of Amazon software systems operated by teams spanning eight Amazon vice-presidents including order processing, fulfillment, transportation, payment processing, cash management, and accounting systems. Then I worked with the affected teams, conducted technical reviews of low-level implementation designs and schedules, ensured all planned changes work well together, meet high-level design requirements, and move forward larger business goals to eliminate manual processes. Participated in SOX reviews for changes to process in the affected technical systems.

  

While working on changes related to ASC 606, I also advised owners of Amazon's ordering, payments, tax, and accounting systems how to update systems to comply with new EU Payment Systems Directive (PSD2) two-factor authentication rules.

  

After technical direction was set, I helped transition project leadership to a principal technical project manager to carry the project to completion.
