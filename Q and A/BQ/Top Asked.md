- About a year ago my boss mentioned that that I could try just start on the work without thinking too much about every detailed aspective, and I thought a lot about this feedback and why she was saying that. And what I realized is that I am a very detailed oriented person, I tend to feel we need to get all scenarios to prepare, every detailed use case or edge case fully covered, sort out all the architect design and workflow from top to bottom before we can really getting it start, by not having everything in front me I am not fully confident to start the project as you know sometimes there's always trade off and I tend to find out a perfect solution before we getting into that point. Once I realize that, I kinda like the attitude of "making thins work is always better than making it perfect", it's different for me because I used to plan everything to be best before really jumping into it, but I've been able to find the balance when it would be the best time that we can start, and progress more agilely. and I've seen dramatic improvement in the last year of me delivering exactly what my boss wants.
