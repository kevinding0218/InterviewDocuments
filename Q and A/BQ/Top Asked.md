#### Why Should We Hire You
- Reiterate what you know about the role
- Describe how your experience can address those challenges
- Ask if they agree with your perspective
	- Is this how you see me in this role? Did I miss any key challenge that you see for this job?
#### What is your greatest weakeness?
- Always be telling stories
	1. Name something that maybe you aren't as good at, or a skill that is a work in progress
	2. Describe how you're building that skill
- About a year ago my boss mentioned that that I could try just start on the work without thinking too much about every detailed aspective, and I thought a lot about this feedback and why she was saying that. And what I realized is that I am a very detailed oriented person, I always feel we need to get everything prepared, every detailed use case or edge case fully covered, sort out all
