- thanks for taking the meeting with me I you know I actually wanted you to be one of the first people to know that I just received an offer from another firm and I'm planning on taking it, but I over the last few years learned a ton at this company and actually from you personally it was a great learning experience in terms of learning how to manage people too so thank you for that 

- so my plan was to stay on for the next two weeks help train some of the new staff and just help with the transition in general.
-  we need you here for at least another two months so this is the this

is the busy quarter that you decided to

leave during well compliment you guys

can find a replacement but you know what

if it helps I can help with the

interview process as well and manage

that - over the next couple weeks okay

well a couple weeks is not nearly enough

but at least tell me what company you're

going to I mean how long have you been

thinking about this well actually I

haven't taken the offer yet so I can't

say sorry well you did sign a

non-compete when you join this company

and if you're going to a competitor I

need to know about that because you

would be breaking the law it's a breach

of contract

well actually know that I can keep this

information confidential but don't worry

I read through the agreement and I'm not

in breach of it by any means I think

you're well aware that I know everybody

in the industry and I'm gonna find out

who you're going to anyway and I'm gonna

tell everyone how horrible of an

employee you are completely letting down

the entire team at a time of need

I'm actually really surprised to hear

that sir because you promoted me over

the last year and also I've only

received positive feedback from the team

about my work but to be honest you know

I've read through their agreement and

you have the option of letting me go at

any time and I in turn can also leave at

any time as well because it's an at-will

state so my decision is final at this

point you know if you don't mind please

let me know before the

day if you'd like me to stay on for the

next two weeks to help with the

transition alright so that obviously
