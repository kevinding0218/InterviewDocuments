- thanks for taking the meeting with me I you know I actually wanted you to be one of the first people to know that I just received an offer from another firm and I'm planning on taking it, but I over the last few years learned a ton at this company and actually from you personally it was a great learning experience in terms of learning how to manage people too so thank you for that 

- so my plan was to stay on for the next two weeks help train some of the new staff and just help with the transition in general.
-  you guys can find a replacement but you know what if it helps I can help with the interview process as well and manage that - over the next couple weeks.

- actually I haven't taken the offer yet so I can't say sorry 

- well actually know that I can keep this information confidential but don't worry I read through the agreement and I'm not
 in breach of it by any means

- I'm actually really surprised to hear that sir because you promoted me over the last year and also I've only received positive feedback from the team about my work but to be honest you know

I've read through their agreement and

you have the option of letting me go at

any time and I in turn can also leave at

any time as well because it's an at-will

state so my decision is final at this

point you know if you don't mind please

let me know before the

day if you'd like me to stay on for the

next two weeks to help with the

transition alright so that obviously
