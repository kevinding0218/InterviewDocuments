- thanks for taking the meeting with me, you know I actually wanted you to be one of the first people to know that I just received offers from other firms and I'm planning on taking it, over the last few years I learned a ton at Cvent and from you personally as well, it was a great learning experience in terms of learning how to lead a team too so thank you for that 

- so my plan was to stay on for the next two weeks help train some of the new staff and just help with the transition in general and my last day would be this June 30, the next next Wednesday, if there is anything I can help with, please feel free to let me know
- 
-  you guys can find a replacement but you know what if it helps I can help with the interview process as well and manage that - over the next couple weeks.

- actually I haven't taken the offer yet so I can't say sorry 

- well actually know that I can keep this information confidential but don't worry I read through the agreement and I'm not
 in breach of it by any means

- I'm actually really surprised to hear that sir because you promoted me over the last year and also I've only received positive feedback from the team about my work but to be honest you know I've read through their agreement and you have the option of letting me go at any time and I in turn can also leave at any time as well because it's an at-will state 

- so my decision is final at this point you know if you don't mind please let me know before the day if you'd like me to stay on for the next two weeks to help with the transition alright
