#### What's your expected salary
- Hey I'm just curious, what's the compensation band for this position?
- I actually haven't put much thought into this. This is a really important thing, so let me take some time to just think about this and can we revisit this later?
#### How does the salary range sound to you? Do you like this number?
- That's a really good start
#### When got the job offer
- Truthfully, you know, I've been really busy prepping for the interview, I haven't put much thought into this. If you don't mind, just kindly go over the compensation structure and the perks and benefits? Then we can take it from there.
- You know, this is a little bit newer for me, and everyone has a different compensation structure, I know I'm not comparing apples to apples, if you don't mind just sharing the numbers with me first, it would be super productive/effective/helpful for me. I would greatly appreciated it.
#### Ask question
- Bouns structure: how does that work? When is the payout, is it once a year or twice a year,
- Is there any other bonus on top of, you know, what you guys offer and things like 
#### For companies that don't offer a bonus
- Hey since you don't off
