#### What's your expected salary
- Hey I'm just curious, **what's the compensation band for this position**?
- **I actually haven't put much thought into this.** This is a really important thing, so let me take some time to just think about this and can we revisit this later?
- I am very glad you ask about this, but my top priority is finding the right fit, so once we find that, I'm happy to discuss salary, **I really love getting to know you guys**, I did a little bit research, and I saw that the industry average is X, and the offer that you gave me is slightly below that, is there anyways that we could possibly make up the difference?
- Thank you so much for investing the time and resources throughout the process to meet with me to chat with me, 
- Compensation is important to me, **I really want to look at the entire value of working at your company**, what I get to do, who I get to do with, the training opportunities, the career advancement opportunities, the benefit, vacation and all of the things that's going along with the company. 
- At the moment, to give you any kind of estimate would be uneducated on my part. 
- I am sure XXX will be **offering a competitve salary within the industry standards,** 
#### How does the salary range sound to you? Do you like this number?
- That's a really good start
#### When got the job offer
- Truthfully, you know, **I've been really busy prepping for the interview, I haven't put much thought into this. If you don't mind, just kindly go over the compensation structure and the perks and benefits?** Then we can take it from there.
- You know, **this is a little bit newer for me, and everyone has a different compensation structure, I know I'm not comparing apples to apples, if you don't mind just sharing the numbers with me first, it would be super productive/effective/helpful for me**. I would greatly appreciated it.
#### Ask question
- **Bouns structure**: how does that work? When is the payout, is it once a year or twice a year,
- **Is there any other bonus on top of**, you know, what you guys offer and things like 
#### For companies that don't offer a bonus
- Hey since you don't offer me any bonuses, what I want to be mindful of this inflation, and you know living costs are just keep going up. So essentially if I don't take this into consideration now, the longer I stay with the company, essentially the less my take-home pay is going to be, and **I don't want to be in a position where salary is a thing for me to have to leave the company**, so I hope you understand where I'm coming from.
#### Comminucate via Email
- This is a lot of good information, let me just take some time to process all of this and get back to you later. Would that make sense for you/would that work for you?
#### Negotiate
- I know I said a different target salary, but after interviewing with other companies, and getting a better sense of my value, I've seen that I should be aiming for X dollars, 
- I've seen that the range in the market is X to Y salary, could we make up the difference
- Upon reflection of thinking through my next career step, I realized my desired salary is X, I appreciated your understanding. 
- I've been dreaming about working for you guys since I started interviewing here, so I just want to ask one more time, is there any possible way that we can make up a bit of the gap?

### Example
_**Recruiter:** “May I ask how much you make at your current company? We're trying to gauge if you're in the right range.”_
_**You:**_ _“I am very open to negotiation, but my top priority is finding the right fit. Once that is established, I am more than happy to talk salary.”_

_**Recruiter:**_  _“I completely understand that you want to find a good fit – so do we! However, we don't move forward with candidates unless we know what range they fit in.”_
**You:** “Of course, that makes sense! Would you be open to sharing the range you have budgeted for this role? That way we can make sure we're aligned from the get go and we're making the best use of both our time.

Start off the conversation like this…

_“[Name], thank you very much for your consideration – I am incredibly thrilled to have this opportunity and I really appreciate all of the time and effort you all have put into this process. I have done some comprehensive research during my process and have found that the average salary for this position is around  **$XXX,XXX – $YYY,YYY***. Is there any way we can make up the difference there?”_

_"Thanks so much for the information around the position. I really appreciate it! I mentioned that I did some research and I wanted to share what I found. From ~25 submissions, the average salary for this position appears to be  **$XXX,XXX**. Additionally, the lowest salary in the range is  **$YYY,YYY** however almost 70% of the salaries are at least $30,000 higher. I am curious as to why this salary is much lower than the average that you are paying other people for this position._

_I don’t mean to come off as aggressive or pushy, I would just like to have all of my bases covered before I make a decision. I am extremely excited about the opportunity to work for  **[Company]**  and I am ready to say yes pending this one detail._

_Lastly, I’ve put together a proposal that includes several solutions to some of the largest challenges the team is current facing. I’ve attached it here but it should help the team overcome some of the obstacles they have been facing and help boost  **[Performance Metric]**._

_Please let me know if it would be possible for you all to take another look given the information above._

_Best,_"
