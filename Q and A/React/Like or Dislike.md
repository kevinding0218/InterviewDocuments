I use React professionally; but am happy enough switching between frameworks.

_Likes_:

-   easy enough to learn
-   component based
-   good employment prospects
-   powerful backing: it's going to be around for a while I guess
-   plenty of support/instructions available
-   flexible
-   available libraries
-   well established

_Dislikes_:

-   JSX: conditional output can sometimes feel clunky compared to a template-based approach; though Array.map(renderElement)  _is_  some consolation
-   state management - usually requires additional libraries like redux (the counterpoint to flexibility is that you have to do extra work yourself and everyone has a different idea of the best approach)
-   boilerplate (especially with redux)
-   payload: you have to ship the framework in your bundle
-   virtual DOM solves a problem that shouldn't be there (see Svelte below)
-   Accessibility (more an issue of how it gets used of course)
-   powerful backing isn't always a good thing: facebook aren't getting very good press in terms of their ethics lately
-   almost too popular: reduced competition can lead to stagnation and complacency. Too much noise when searching for solutions/libraries etc.
