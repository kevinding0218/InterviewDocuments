### Why do you like or dislike React?
I use React professionally; but am happy enough switching between frameworks.

### Likes_:
-   easy enough to learn
-   component based
-   version stable (compared to Angular)
-   plenty of support/instructions available
-   flexible
-   available libraries
-   well established

### Dislikes_:
-   JSX: conditional output can sometimes feel clunky compared to a template-based approach; though Array.map(renderElement)  _is_  some consolation
-   state management - usually requires additional libraries like redux (the counterpoint to flexibility is that you have to do extra work yourself and everyone has a different idea of the best approach)
-   boilerplate (especially with redux)
-   payload: you have to ship the framework in your bundle
-   powerful backing isn't always a good thing: facebook aren't getting very good press in terms of their ethics lately
-   almost too popular: reduced competition can lead to stagnation and complacency. Too much noise when searching for solutions/libraries etc.
### Angular. 
- More complete in that it provides structure for state management and an opinionated framework for adding things like services: less to think about; but less flexible and more to learn. Well established and backed by Google
