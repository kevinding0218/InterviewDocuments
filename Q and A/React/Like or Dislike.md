### Why do you like or dislike React?
I use React professionally; but am happy enough switching between frameworks.

### Likes
-   easy enough to learn (compared to Angular)
-   component based
-   version stable (compared to Angular)
-   plenty of support/instructions available
-   flexible
-   available libraries
-   well established

### Dislikes
-   JSX: conditional output can sometimes feel clunky compared to a template-based approach; though Array.map(renderElement)  _is_  some consolation
-   state management - usually requires additional libraries like redux (the counterpoint to flexibility is that you have to do extra work yourself and everyone has a different idea of the best approach)
-   boilerplate (especially with redux)
-   payload: you have to ship the framework in your bundle

### Angular. 
- More complete in that it provides structure for state management and an opinionated framework for adding things like services: 
- less to think about; but less flexible and more to learn. 
- Well established and backed by Google
