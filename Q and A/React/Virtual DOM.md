### Explain Virtual DOM
- Before react came along with virtual dome, updating the dome is really expensive because every time you update something you have to repaint that on the dome every time and that can be time-consuming
- so what the reactant actually does it has its dome tree of its own which it creates during the initial render which is called the virtual DOM. Any updates that tree happens through the change in state and props
