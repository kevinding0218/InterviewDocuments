- Ask Questions!
	- How big is the application
	- What does it do
	- Which version of react it's running
	- What things are we specifically trying to optimize, is it slow? or is it crashing? or is the bundle size too big?
- Performance related instead of speed
	- First Profiler to the app and then run the app to see which areas of the app is behaving
