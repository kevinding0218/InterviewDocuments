### What is SOA
_A Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)_  is basically defined as an architectural pattern consisting of services. Here application components provide services to the other components using communication protocol over the network. This communication involves data exchanging or some coordination activity between services.

Some of the key principles on which SOA is based are mentioned below

-   The service contract should be standardized containing all the description of the services.
-   There is loose coupling defining the less dependency between the web services and the client.
-   It should follow Service Abstraction rule, which says the service should not expose the way functionality has been executed to the client application.
-   Services should be reusable in order to work with various application types.
-   Services should be stateless having the feature of discoverability.
-   Services break big problems into little problems and allow diverse subscribers to use the services.
