### Best practise for designing a REST
-  Every input on the server should be validated.
-  Input should be well-formed.
-  Never pass any sensitive data through URL.
-  For any session, the user should be authenticated.
-  Only HTTP error messages should be used for indicating any fault.
-  Use message format that is easily understood and is required by the client.
-  Unified Resource Identifier should be descriptive and easily understood.
