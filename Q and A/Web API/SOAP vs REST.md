### What are different types of Web Services?
There are two types of web services:
-   **SOAP Web Services**: Runs on SOAP protocol and uses XML technology for sending data.
-   **Restful Web Services**: Itâ€™s an architectural style and runs on HTTP/HTTPS protocol almost all the time. REST is a stateless client-server architecture where web services are resources and can be identified by their URIs. Client applications can use HTTP GET/POST methods to invoke Restful web services.
