## What is SOAP?
- _SOAP_  stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. SOAP is an XML based industry standard protocol for designing and developing web services. Since it’s XML based, it’s platform and language independent. So our server can be based on JAVA and client can be on .NET, PHP etc. and vice versa.
### What are different types of Web Services?
There are two types of web services:
-   **SOAP Web Services**: Runs on SOAP protocol and uses XML technology for sending data.
-   **Restful Web Services**: It’s an architectural style and runs on HTTP/HTTPS protocol almost all the time. REST is a stateless client-server architecture where web services are resources and can be identified by their URIs. Client applications can use HTTP GET/POST methods to invoke Restful web services.
