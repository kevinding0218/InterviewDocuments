### What are advantages of REST web services?
Some of the advantages of REST web services are:

-   Learning curve is easy since it works on HTTP protocol
-   Supports multiple technologies for data transfer such as text, xml, json, image etc.
-   No contract defined between server and client, so loosely coupled implementation.
-   REST is a lightweight protocol
-   REST methods can be tested easily over browser.
### What is Stateless
- SERVER has no state (or session data)
- ST itself defines State Transfer and Statelessness means complete isolation. This means, the state of the clientâ€™s application is never stored on the server and is passed on.
- In this process, the clients send all the information that is required for the server to fulfill the HTTP request that has been sent. Thus every client requests and the response is independent of the other with complete assurance of providing the required information.
### Mention some key characteristics of REST?
-   REST is stateless, therefore the SERVER has no state (or session data)
-   With a well-applied REST API, the server could be restarted between two calls as every data is passed to the server
-   Web service mostly uses POST method to make operations, whereas REST uses GET to access resources
