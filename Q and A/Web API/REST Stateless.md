### What is Stateless
- ST itself defines State Transfer and Statelessness means complete isolation. This means, the state of the clientâ€™s application is never stored on the server and is passed on.
- In this process, the clients send all the information that is required for the server to fulfill the HTTP request that has been sent. Thus every client requests and the response is independent of the other with complete assurance of providing the required information.
