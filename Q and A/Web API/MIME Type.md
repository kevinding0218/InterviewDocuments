MIME is an acronym for  **M**ulti-purpose  **I**nternet  **M**ail  **E**xtensions. It is used as a standard way of classifying file types over the Internet.

Web servers and browsers have a defined list of MIME types, which facilitates transfer of files of a known type, irrespective of operating system or browser.

A MIME type actually has two parts: a  _type_  and a  _subtype_  that are separated by a slash (/). For example, the MIME type for Microsoft Word files is  `application/msword`  (i.e., type is  `application`  and the subtype is  `msword`).
