### Cache-control
- A standard Cache-control header can help in attaining cache ability. Enlisted below is the brief description of the various cache-control header:
-   **Public:**  Resources that are marked as the public can be cached by any intermediate components between the client and the server.
-   **Private:**  Resources that are marked as private can only be cached by the client.
-   No cache means that a particular resource cannot be cached and thus the whole process is stopped.
