###  Concurrency vs Parallelism
- **Concurrency**  is when two or more tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time  **periods**. It doesn't necessarily mean they'll ever both be running  **at the same instant**. For example,  _multitasking_  on a single-core machine.
	- If two or more problems are solved by a single processor.

- **Parallelism**  is when tasks  _literally_  run at the same time, e.g., on a multicore processor.
	- If one problem is solved by multiple processors.
