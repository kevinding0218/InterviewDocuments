### CDNs and Cache-Control
- The variety of caching headers can make manual cache management overwhelming. CDNs allow for granular cache policy management through a user-friendly dashboard, relieving you of the need to manually tweak individual headers.
- In addition to simplifying cache management, CDNs augment the browser caching process using proxies. Proxy caching brings content closer to site visitors, accelerating the delivery of locally stored resources. This is especially beneficial for first-time visitors whose browsers have yet to cache site content.
- Finally, more advanced CDNs use advanced automation techniques, including machine learning, to cache dynamically generated content and resources. This optimizes your caching policies and further speeds up content delivery.
