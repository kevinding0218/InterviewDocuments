### Builder
- Builder design pattern is an alternative way to construct complex objects and should be used only when we want to build different types of immutable objects using same object building process.
### Factory
- Factory design pattern is most suitable when complex object creation steps are involved. To ensure that these steps are centralized and not exposed to composing classes.
### Singleton
- Singleton enables an application to have one and only one instance of a class per JVM.
