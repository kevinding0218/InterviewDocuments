-   The  **browser checks the cache for a DNS record**  to find the corresponding IP address of your url
    -   DNS(Domain Name System) is a database that maintains the name of the website (URL) and the particular IP address it links to. Every single URL on the internet has a unique IP address assigned to it.
    -   You can easily access a website by typing the correct IP address, but  **it is easier to remember the name of the website using an URL and let DNS do the work for us**  with mapping it to the correct IP.
    -   First, it checks the  **browser cache**. The browser maintains a repository of DNS records for a fixed duration for websites you have previously visited.
    -   Second, the browser checks the  **OS cache**. If it is not found in the browser cache, the browser would make a system call
    -   Third, it checks the  **router cache**. If it’s not found on your computer, the browser would communicate with the router that maintains its’ own cache of DNS records.
    -   Fourth, it checks the  **ISP (Internet Service Provider) cache**. If all steps fail, the browser would move on to the ISP. Your ISP maintains its’ own DNS server which includes a cache of DNS records which the browser would check with the last hope of finding your requested URL.
-   If the requested URL is not in the cache,  **ISP’s DNS server initiates a DNS query to find the IP address of the server**  that hosts  [maps.google.com](http://maps.google.com/).
-   Browser  **initiates a TCP connection**  with the server.
    -   In order to transfer data packets between your computer(client) and the server, it is important to have a TCP connection established.
    -   This connection is established using a process called the  **TCP/IP three-way handshake**. This is a three step process where the client and the server exchange SYN(synchronize) and ACK(acknowledge) messages to establish a connection.
        -   Client machine sends a SYN packet to the server over the internet asking if it is open for new connections.
        -   If the server has open ports that can accept and initiate new connections, it’ll respond with an ACKnowledgment of the SYN packet using a SYN/ACK packet.
        -   The client will receive the SYN/ACK packet from the server and will acknowledge it by sending an ACK packet.
        -   Then a TCP connection is established for data transmission
-   The  **browser sends an HTTP request**  to the web server
    -   The browser will send a  **GET**  request asking for  [maps.google.com](http://maps.google.com/)  web page.
    -   If you’re entering credentials or submitting a form this could be a  **POST**  request.
    -   This request will also contain additional information such as browser identification (_User-Agent_  header), types of requests that it will accept (_Accept_  header), and connection headers asking it to keep the TCP connection alive for additional requests.
    -   It will also pass information taken from cookies the browser has in store for this domain.
-   The server handles the request and sends back a response.
    -   it will assemble a response in a particular format (JSON, XML, HTML).
-   The  **server sends out an HTTP response**
    -   The server response contains the web page you requested as well as the status code, compression type (_Content-Encoding)_, how to cache the page (_Cache-Control_), any cookies to set, privacy information, etc.
-   The  **browser displays the HTML content**  (for HTML responses which is the most common)
