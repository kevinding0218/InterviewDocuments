### Data Storage
- SQL Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL) 
- NoSQL database (Cassandra, DynamoDB)
- Cache (Redis)
- Stream processing (Kafka + Spark)
- Cloud native stream processing (Kinesis)
- Batch processing (Hadoop MapReduce)

### What questions we must think or ask ("Count of videos" design)
- Help interviewers to understand your design scope
- Users/Customers : help us understand what data we store in the system
	- Who will use the system?
		- is this all Youtube viewers who will see the total views count for a video?
		- is this a per-hour statistics available to a video owners only
		- is this used by some machine learning models to generate recommendations
	- How the system will be used?
		- data may be used by marketing department only to generate some monthly reports,
			- meaning data is retrieved not often
		- data is sent to recommendation service in real-time
			- meaning data may be retrieved from the system with a very high pace
		- questions in this category 
- Scale (read and write): give us a clue how much data is coming to the system and how much data is retrieved from the system
	- How many read queries per second the system needs to process?
	- How much data is queried per request?
	- How many video views are processed per second?
	- Can there be spikes in traffic and how big they may be?
- Performance: help us quickly evaluate different design options
	- What is expected write-to-read data delay? 
		- if we can count views several hours later than these views actually happened, both batch data processing and stream processing design options can be considered
		- but if time matters and we need to count views on the fly in real-time, batch data processing might be slow and not considered as an option,
	- What is exepcted p99 latency for read queries? how fast data must be retrieved from the system
		- if interviewer tells us that response time must be as small as possible,  it's a hint that we must count views when we write data, and we should do minimal or no counting calculation when we read data, in other words, data must already be aggregated.
- Cost: help us evaluate technology stack
	- Should the design minimize the cost of development?
		- if asked to minimize development cost, we should be leaning towards well-regarded open-source frameworks
	- Should the design minimize the cost of maintenance?
		- if future maintenance cost is a primary concern, we should consider publich cloud services
