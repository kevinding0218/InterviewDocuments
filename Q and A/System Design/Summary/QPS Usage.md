### QPS vs Webserver
- QPS = 100, we can use our laptop to host the web server
- QPS = 1k, we need some better webserver and we might need to consider single point failure
- QPS = 1m, we probably need a cluster of 1k web servers, we need more consideration about maintainance such as what if one of the server goes down
