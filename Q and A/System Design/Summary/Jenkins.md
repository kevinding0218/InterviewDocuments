### Functional
- Building Code
- Deploying Code
### Non Functional
- High Scalability : ask scale like how many machines across world
- High Availability: Two to Three 9 like anywhere between half a day and three days of downtime per year
- High Performance: deploy time (within 30 mins?
- How often are we going to deploy code and how big are these binaries that we're going to be getting,  (1000s deploy per day, 10GB per binary)

### High Level
- First design build the code
- Then deploy the code
