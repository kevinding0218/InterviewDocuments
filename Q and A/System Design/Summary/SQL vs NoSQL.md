### SQL
- Relational databases store data in rows and columns. Each row contains all
the information about one entity and each column contains all the separate
data points.
### NoSQL
- **Key-Value** Stores: Data is stored in an array of key-value pairs. The ‘key’ is an attribute name which is linked to a ‘value’. e.g: **Redis**
- Document Databases: data is stored in documents (instead of rows and columns in a table) and these documents are grouped together in collections, Each document can have an entirely different structure, e.g: Couchbase	and MongoDB
- Wide-Column Databases
