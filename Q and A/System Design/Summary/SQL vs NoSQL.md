### SQL
- Relational databases store data in rows and columns. Each row contains all
the information about one entity and each column contains all the separate
data points.
### NoSQL
- Key-Value Stores: Data is stored in an array of key-value pairs. The ‘key’ is an attribute name which is linked to a ‘value’. Well-known key-value stores
include Redis
