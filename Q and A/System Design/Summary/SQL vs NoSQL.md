### SQL
- SQL stores data in tables where each row represents an entity and each column represents a data point about that entity, 
### NoSQL
- 
- **Key-Value** Stores: Data is stored in an array of key-value pairs. The ‘key’ is an attribute name which is linked to a ‘value’. e.g: **Redis**
- **Document Databases**: data is stored in documents (instead of rows and columns in a table) and these documents are grouped together in collections, Each document can have an entirely different structure, e.g: **Couchbase and MongoDB**
- **Wide-Column Databases**: Unlike relational databases, we don’t need to know all the columns up front and each row doesn’t have to have the same number of columns, e.g: **Cassandra**
- **Graph Databases**: These databases are used to store data whose relations are best represented in a graph
