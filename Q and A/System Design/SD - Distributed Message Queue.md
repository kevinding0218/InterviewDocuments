### What is distributed message queue
- Let's say there are two web-services called producer and consumer, and they need to communicate with each other.
- One option is to setup a synchronous communication, when producer makes a call to a consumer and waits for a response.
	- This approach has its own pros and cons. Synchronous communication is easier and faster to implement. At the same time synchronous communication makes it harder to deal with consumer service failures. 
	- We need to think when and how to properly retry failed requests, how not to overwhelm consumer service with too many requests and how to deal with a slow consumer service host. 
- Another option is to introduce a new component that helps to setup asynchronous communication. Producer sends data to that component and exactly one consumer gets this data a short time after. Such component is called a queue.
- And it is distributed, because data is stored across several machines. 
- Please do not confuse queue with a topic.
	- In case of a topic, message that is published goes to each and every subscriber.
	- In case of a queue, message is received by one and only one consumer.
### Functional Requirements
- At this stage of the interview it may be hard to come up with a definitive set of requirements. And itâ€™s usually not needed.
- Time limit allows us to only focus on several core APIs, like **send message and receive message**.
### Non Functional Requirements
- we want our system to be **scalable** and handle load increase, highly **available** and tolerate hardware and network failures, highly **performant**, so that both send and receive operations are fast, and durable, so that data is persisted once submitted to the queue.
- there may be many other requirements either explicitly stated by the interviewer or intentionally omitted.
