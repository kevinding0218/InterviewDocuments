### What is HashMap
1.  HashMap implements Map interface and maintains key and value pairs.
2.  HashMap internally works on the principle of Hashing
3.  HashMap can only contain unique keys and only one null key.
4.  HashMap methods are non-synchornized.
5.  HashMap lookups are O(1) in the average case, and  O(n) in the worst case
### How HashMap works internally ?
HashMap works on the principle of Hashing.
1.  Hash Function - the `hashCode()` method which returns an integer value is the Hash function.
2.  Hash Value - return an int value by the hash function
3.  Bucket - used to store key value pairs. A bucket can have multiple key-value pairs, In hash map, bucket used is simply a linked list or RedBlack Tree to store objects
4. HashMap get(Key k) method calls hashCode method on the key object and applies returned hashValue to its own static hash function to find a bucket location(backing array)
### What if when two different keys have the same HashCode?
- In this situation equals() method comes to rescue.
- Since bucket is one and we have two objects with the same hashcode. The bucket is the linked list effectively. So we traverse through linked list , comparing keys in each entries using keys.equals() until it return true. Then the corresponding entry object Value is returned .
### Hash Collision
- Collisions happen when 2 distinct keys generate the same hashCode() value.
- There are many collision-resolution strategies â€“ chaining, double-hashing, clustering. However, java has chosen chaining strategy for hashMap, so in case of collisions, items are chained together just like in a linkedList.
### HashTable vs HashMap vs HashSet
- HashTable for multi thread, that it's safe to visit HashTable across multi thread
- HashMap for single thread
- HashSet no value
### HashMap vs LinkedHashMap vs TreeMap
1.  **HashMap**  :-  `HashMap`  never preserves your Insertion Order. It Internally Use a hashing Concept by which it generate a  `HashCode`  to the Corresponding  `key`  and add it to the  `HashMap`.
2.  **LinkedHashMap**  :-  `LinkedHashMap`  It preserves your Insertion Order. and  `keys`  will be found as same order you Insert into this  `LinkedHashMap`.
3.  **TreeMap**  :- The  `TreeMap`  class implements the  `Map`  **interface**  by using a  **Tree**. A  `TreeMap`  provides an efficient means of storing  **key/value**  pairs in sorted order, and allows rapid retrieval.
	- unlike a `HashMap`, a tree map guaran
### What is ConcurrentHashMap
- A concurrentHashMap is divided into number of segments [default 16] on initialization.
- ConcurrentHashMap allows similar number (16) of threads to access these segments concurrently so that each thread work on a specific segment during high concurrency.
- This way, if when your key-value pair is stored in segment 10; code does not need to block other 15 segments additionally. This structure provides a very high level of concurrency.
- In other words, ConcurrentHashMap uses a multitude of locks, each lock controls one segment of the map.
	- When setting data in a particular segment, the lock for that segment is obtained. So essentially update operations are synchronized.
	- When getting data, a volatile read is used without any synchronization. If the volatile read results in a miss, then the lock for that segment is obtained and entry is again searched in synchronized block.
