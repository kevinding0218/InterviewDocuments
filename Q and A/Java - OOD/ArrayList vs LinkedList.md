### ArrayList vs LinkedList vs Vector
- Of the three,  `LinkedList` is generally going to give you the best performance. Hereâ€™s why:
- `ArrayList` and  `Vector`  each **use an array to store the elements** of the list. As a result, when an element is inserted into (or removed from) the middle of the list, the elements that follow must all be shifted accordingly. 
	- `Vector`  is synchronized, so if a thread-safe implementation is  _not_  needed, it is recommended to use  `ArrayList`  rather than Vector.
- `LinkedList`, on the other hand, is implemented using a doubly linked list. As a result, an inserting or removing an element only requires updating the links that immediately precede and follow the element being inserted or removed.
