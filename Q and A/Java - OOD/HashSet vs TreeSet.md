### HashSet vs TreeSet
- At first glance,  `HashSet`  is superior in almost every way: O(1)  `add`,  `remove`  and  `contains`, vs. O(log(N)) for  `TreeSet`.
- However,  `TreeSet`  is indispensable when you wish to **maintain order over the inserted elements** or **query for a range of elements within the set.**
