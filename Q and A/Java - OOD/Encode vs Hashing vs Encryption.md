### Encoding :
In the Encoding method, data is transformed from one form to another. The main aim of encoding is to transform data into a form that is readable by most of the systems or that can be used by any external process.  
It canâ€™t be used for securing data, various publicly available algorithms are used for encoding.

Encoding can be used for  **reducing the size**  of audio and video files. Each audio and video file format has a corresponding coder-decoder (codec) program that is used to code it into the appropriate format and then decodes for playback.

**Encryption :**
