## MicroServices
### **Definition**
- microservices as an **architectural pattern** for creating applications. Under this pattern, applications are structured as **a collection of loosely coupled services**.
- This is distinct from **traditional applications** that are structured as **single self-contained artifacts**
### **Advantage**
- It is _so_ much **easier** to **develop**, **integrate**, and **maintain** applications since **individual functionalities are treated separately**, 
	- allowing you to build applications step-by-step or Allow small independent teams that take ownership of their services.
- **independently deployable and scalable, be more agile**
	- If a service needs changed, you just change that one, none of its kin. 
	- If you want to try a new framework or language, just make a drop-in replacement for that one service.
	- If you suddenly need 100x capacity, spin up some new machines with that service to handle that influx.
### **Disadvantage**
- **Developing** distributed systems can be complex. Since everything is now an independent service, you have to carefully handle requests traveling between your modules. 
	- In one such scenario, developers may be forced to **write extra code to avoid disruption**.
	- Over time, complications will arise when **remote calls experience latency**.
- **Testing** a microservices-based application can be cumbersome.
	- With microservices, each dependent service needs to be confirmed before testing can occur.
	- With traditional approach, we would just need to launch our WAR on an application server and ensure its connectivity with the underlying database.
- **Deploying** microservices can be complex.
	- They may need coordination among multiple services
	- The best way to deploy microservices-based applications is within **containers**, which are _complete virtual operating system environments_ that provide processes with isolation and dedicated access to underlying hardware resources.
### Micro service vs API
- API is usually a _portion_ of a microservice and focus on how to expose micro service
- API serves as a contract for interactions within the micro service
### [Challenges](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/architect-microservice-container-applications/distributed-data-management)
#### How to define the boundaries of each microservice
- Focus on the application's logical domain models and related data. 
- Try to identify decoupled islands of data and different contexts within the same application. 
- Each service has a single responsibility.
- There are no chatty calls between services.
- Each service is small enough that it can be built by a small team working independently
- Your service boundaries will not create problems with data consistency or integrity.
#### How to create queries that retrieve data from several microservices
- API Gateway
- CQRS
- SignalR
### Deal with large amount of data
- **Steaming**
	- Let's imagine the 100 MB file is received by the service A which transfers it to service B, which, in turn, uses service C to do the actual parsing of the proprietary format.
	- The wrong approach would be for the services A and B to start sending the file to the underlying service only  _after_  they completely received the file from the client:
	- Instead, as soon as they _start_ receiving the file, they should stream it to the underlying service.

	- This means that you're not waiting the time it takes to transfer 100 MB three times, but only one time, plus the latency...
- **Latency by location** that services are hosted


## Docker
### How I used to work without Docker
- when docker and container are not such popular, we had issue that once we finish some application and want to maintain this, in order to make it maintainable, I have to create a snapshot of the virtual machine, and that snapshot contains all my current infrastructure, all applications had to be part of whole system and each application had to be exact version because of dependency and for one day, it bumps and had some breaking changes, once you upgrade this, your application will be broken because inside we would have some errors that we need to resolve. 
- The typical way is to create the whole snapshot of the virtual machine and then when you want to change something, you had to change the whole virtual machine which was kind of slow because virtual machine is slow and not efficient.
- Another scenario is one had to install everything every dependency with proper version on his local machine, sometime it led issue that things works on one machine but not another.
### Why using Docker
- Docker containers are isolated, but share OS and where appropriate, bins/libraries, result is fast deployment, much less overhead, easier migration, faster restart.
- You will use your system kernel and you'll be able to very quickly deploy your applications reusing your local operating system, and these applications will think like they're in their own environment.
### Dockerfile
- Base layer: Get the asp.net core run time
```DOCKER
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:2.2
```
- Provide published files with `COPY` to source destination
```DOCKER
# COPY  FROM bin/docker to here
COPY ./bin/docker .
```
- Specify Entry Point
```DOCKER
ENTRYPOINT dotnet NextDoor.Services.Identity.dll
```
### Local Deployment
- publish our application into bin/docker
```BASH
dotnet publish -c Release -o bin/docker
``` 
- Build Docker Image
```BASH
docker build -t nextdoor.services.identity .
```
- Check created images
```BASH
docker images
```
- Run the image
```BASH
docker run nextdoor.services.identity (or ImageID)
```
- Create docker settings file for RabbitMQ config
	- Create a new file `appsettings.docker.json`
	- Copy settings of `RabbitMQ` and change hostnames to be **host.docker.internal**
- Declare environment variables in DockerFile
```DOCKER
# Load appsettings.docker.json
ENV ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT docker
# You can use same port for different containers because each container had their own IP address 
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS http://*:5000
# Previously if you don't use EXPOSE, you couldn't reach your container even within the private docker network from the other container, but now don't have to do it since your container will be available in a private local network
#EXPOSE 5000
```
- 
- Rebuild our image
```DOCKER
docker build -t nextdoor.services.identity .
```
- Re-run the docker image and specify 5010 as public port and 5000 as private port
```DOCKER
docker run -p 5010:5000 nextdoor.services.identity:latest
```
