#### What is GraphQL
- Is a query language for your API, not a library, not a product and not a database
- Traditional way of not using GraphQL is we request the API endpint while expect to receive a massive JSON object from response
	- Client -> endpoint  -> API -> database -> API -> JSON object -> Client
- GraphQL lets you write a query to request the exactly the data that you want ad receive the result back with just what you want
	- Client/Mobile -> Query -> GraphQL Server -> database -> JSON object -> Client/Mobile
