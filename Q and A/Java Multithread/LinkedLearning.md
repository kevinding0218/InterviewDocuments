## Sequential vs Parallel Computing
### Making salad as an example
- Chopping lettuce, tomato cucumber, onion and put dressing
###  Sequential
- Program is broken down of sequatial instruction that I execute one after another
- Can only execute one at a given moment
### Parallel
- Program is broken down into independent parts that can be executed simultaneously by different processors
- Doesn't necessarily mean we'll make the process twice as fast, because we've to add extra effort like in kitchen to communicate with each other to corrdinate our actions.
	- There might be times that one of us having to wait for the other cook to finish a certain step before we continue on
	- Parallel execution will increase the overall throughput of a program.
		- Accomplish a single task faster
		- Accomplish more tasks in a given time
