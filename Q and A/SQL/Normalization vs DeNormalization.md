### Normalization
- Normalization is the process to remove or organize redundant data from the database and to store minimize  redundant and consistent data into it.
- Focus on clearing the database from unused data to reduce
- During Normalization as data is reduced so a number of tables are deleted from the database hence tables are lesser in number.
- Normalization uses optimized memory and hence faster in performance.
#### 1NF
- Each column contains atomic values and there are not repeating groups of columns, e.g: 
	- A column stores both Physical Address and Email Address needs to separate it out
	- A co
#### 2NF
- 
### Denormalization
- Denormalization is used to combine multiple table data into one so that it can be queried quickly. The process of attempting to optimize the performance of a database by adding redundant data.
- Focus on achieve the faster execution of the queries
- Denormalization data is integrated into the same database and hence a number of tables to store that data increases in number.
- Denormalization introduces some sort of wastage of memory.
