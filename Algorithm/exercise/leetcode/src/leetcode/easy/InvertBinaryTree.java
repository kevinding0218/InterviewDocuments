     This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
     "Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), 
     but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off."

     * The inverse of an empty tree is the empty tree.

     * is a tree with root r, whose right subtree is the inverse of {left},

     * Initially, only the root is in the queue.

     * swap its children, and add the children to the queue.

     * the queue will be empty and all the children swapped,
