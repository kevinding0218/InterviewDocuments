		Input: "babad"

		Output: "bab"

		Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
		Example:

		Input: "cbbd"

		Output: "bb"

	/**
	 * 
	 * We observe that a palindrome mirrors around its center. 
	 * Therefore, a palindrome can be expanded from its center, and there are only 2n - 12nâˆ’1 such centers.

	 * You might be asking why there are 2n - 1 but not n centers? 
	 * The reason is the center of a palindrome can be in between two letters. 
	 * Such palindromes have even number of letters (such as "abba") and its center are between the two 'b's.
